
In this situation, you can use the debug module. Adding it to your project is as easy as:

npm install debug --save
Then:

const debug = require('debug')('my-namespace')
const name = 'my-app'
debug('booting %s', name)
By default, it will not produce any output. To enable this logger, you have run your application with a special environment variable, called DEBUG.

DEBUG=my-namespace node app.js
Once you do that, the debug module will come to life and will start producing log events for stdout.

Luckily, this module is widespread in the Node.js community, so if you are using a popular project, like Express, chances are high you can use the debug module with that. Also, you can inspect multiple modules at once, by separating the names with a comma.

DEBUG=my-namespace,express* node app.js
