What is JSON?

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and a typically JSON data structure looks like this:

{
    "name": "Your Name",
    "age": 29,
    "courses": [
        "angular-the-complete-guide",
        "react-the-complete-guide"
    ],
    "profile": {
        "joined": "2017-05-21",
        "courses": 2
    },
    "averageRating": 4.8,
    "active": true
}
It looks a lot like a normal JavaScript object, but one important difference is that all key names are enclosed by double quotation marks (").

Besides that, you can store text (string), numeric (integers and floats) and boolean data as well as nested objects and arrays.
